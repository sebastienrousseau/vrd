## Overview üìñ

`Random (VRD)` is a Rust library for generating high-quality random numbers based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm.

The Mersenne Twister is a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) that is often used in computer simulations and games. It is a fast and reliable PRNG.

The Random (VRD) is used to generate random numbers using the Mersenne Twister algorithm. It generates pseudorandom integers uniformly distributed in 0..(2^32 - 1) starting from any odd seed in 0..(2^32 - 1).

The index is incremented after each random number is generated. When the index reaches 624, the array is reinitialized and the index is reset to 0.

## Features ‚ú®

- Create new random number generator and seed it with a value.
- Design for speed and efficiency in mind.
- Generate random 32-bit unsigned integer within a given range.
- Provide random numbers of different types, including booleans, bytes, chars, doubles, floats, integers, and unsigned integers.
- Mutate the state of the random number generator.
- Produce pseudo-random number sequences that are different from each other.
- Regulate the randomness of the generated numbers, including the seed value and the number of bits used.
- Select a random element from a slice of values.

## Getting Started üöÄ

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `Random (VRD)`.

### Installation

To install `Random (VRD)`, you need to have the Rust toolchain installed on your machine. You can install the Rust toolchain by following the instructions on the [Rust website][14].

Once you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can install `Random (VRD)` using the following command:

```shell
cargo install vrd
```

You can then run the help command to see the available options:

```shell
vrd --help
```

### Requirements

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is currently Rust **1.69.0** or later (stable). It is recommended that you install the latest stable version of Rust.

### Platform support

`Random (VRD)` is supported and tested on the following platforms:
